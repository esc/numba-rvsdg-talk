==== Definitions ====

* AST ==>  Abstract Syntax Tree
* IR ==> Intermediary Representation
* CFG ==> Control Flow Graph
* DAG ==> Directed Acyclic Graph
* Closed CFG ==> CFG with eaxctly one entry and one exit node
** Entry node ==> No incoming edges
** Exit node ==> No outgoing edges
* SCFG ==>  Structured Control Flow Graph
* RVSDG ==> Regionalized Value State Dependence Graph

==== Pipeline ====

* Ingest Python source
* Convert to AST
* Convert AST to CFG
* Restructure to SCFG
* Synthesize Python source code (implemented)
* Convert to RVSDG (partially implemented)
* Profit! (this is what copilot suggested)
